Introduction

The current predicament regarding the employment environment proves to cause a challenge amongst job-seekers, graduates and career changers. This creates a space where the job-seeking process is tedious and often times demotivating. Therefore, empowering not only these people but also high-school learners and university students is a crucial role that we have took up. The unemployment rate, particularly in South Africa, raises many concerns about the social and societal impact this could have around the livelihood of citizens and the overall functioning of the economy. It is then important that this role we have assumed aims to mediate the stresses and the root causes of unemployment.

Problem Statement

SkillUpZA aims to address the identified problem by developing a comprehensive AI-driven career platform tailored for South African users.
Identifying the root causes :
Although there are many causes of unemployment and they differ from country to country, we will only briefly elaborate on the causes that relate to South Africa and our web application:
•	Lack of career guidance for high school students: High school students often face challenges in selecting a meaningful career path due to insufficient knowledge or guidance. Making significant life decisions at a young age can lead to uncertainty and may result in choices that do not align with long-term fulfilment or enthusiasm. Therefore, there is a need for resources that facilitate informed decision-making and support students in choosing careers that resonate with their passions and aspirations.
•	Under-skilled graduates: Many graduates encounter the common challenge of lacking practical skills required for employment, even with their qualifications. Despite holding degrees or diplomas, a significant portion may find themselves underprepared for the demands of the workforce. This gap extends beyond technical expertise to include essential soft skills, which are increasingly valued by employers.
•	Tedious job-seeking process: While online platforms have made job hunting more convenient, there are still challenges. Sometimes, online job applications lack clarity, which can make job seekers sceptical about the validity of job postings. Additionally, there's the risk of information theft on dubious websites and potentially hazardous redirects, which can compromise individuals' online security and privacy. Furthermore, traditional methods like walk-ins continue to present practical challenges and inefficiencies.
