node_modules

You need to install axios, npm install axios 
I didn't use leaf coz it was showing me flames.

The name of the database is "users" and the table is "credentials"   FOR THE USERS ONLY 
the attributes are: 
-Usename
-Email
-Password
-Mobile Number


The name of the database is "users" and the table is "business"   FOR THE BUSINESS ONLY 
the attributes are: 
-BusinessName
-Email
-Password
-Mobile_Number


TO BE ABLE TO REGISTER AND LOGIN, you will need to save the folder "DATABASE_DATA" which is under the folder "DATA" of the project 
in your xampp folder under "htdocs"; 

Don't forget to run the server "xampp"



I ALSO UPLOADED the dabase tables under the data folder 
so you can just copy and paste the code.

You will also notice that on the dashboard the name of the logged in user is displayed.
